How to Import Functions from Another File
In Python, importing functions from another file is straightforward. Create a Python file (module) with your functions, and use the import statement to bring them into your current script.

How to Use Imported Functions
Once functions are imported, you can use them just like any other functions in your script. Ensure you call the functions with the appropriate arguments and handle their return values accordingly.

How to Create a Module
To create a module, simply save your Python code in a separate file with a .py extension. This file becomes a module that can be imported into other scripts.
